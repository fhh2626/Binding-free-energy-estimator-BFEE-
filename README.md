# Binding-free-energy-estimator-BFEE-

## Note
[BFEE2](https://github.com/fhh2626/BFEE2) has been released. It supports more force fields and reports more detailed error messages. We suggest to use BFEE2 whenever possible, although the original BFEE will still be maintained.

## The original Readme of BFEE
### Binding free energy estimator (BFEE) plugin of VMD

Automate binding free-energy calculation through the geometric and alchemical routes via NAMD and VMD. The latest version of BFEE is always provided herein.
